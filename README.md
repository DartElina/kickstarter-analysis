# Kickstarter-Analysis

## Overview of Project

  The purpose of this analysis was to assist Louise in analyzing her strategy for her next kickstarter campaign. She wanted to know how similar campaigns, theater and plays, fared based on the launch dates versus their goals. She provided kickstarter data. I have analyzed and visualized this data so that Louise can make a better choice for her next campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date:

Using the data provided we filtered for theater campaigns and created a visual that allows us to see the frequency of successes and failures based on Launch dates. As you can see May and June have the highest number of successful campaigns. Additionally, May has the highest number of failed campaigns as well. It is possible that the increased number of successful campaigns is the result of more campaigns launched in May and June overall, not just because these month resulted in more success. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals:

  Using the data from kickstarter we filtered for subcategory plays, sorted campaigns by goal values, and derived the percent of campaign successes, failures and cancels. This allows us to compare the rate of success and failure by goal values. As you can see nearly 80% of goals below $100 succeed, and successes remain above failures until about $20,000 goals at which point there is a 50% of success or failure. There is a bump up in success rates after $30,000 until $50,000, however, the data provided can not explain why there is a bump in this range. Perhaps promotion budgets could be a variable at play here, which could play a role in increasing the number of backers. Again, this could be better concluded with more data.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered:

  I encountered a challenge while creating the outcomes by goals chart. My chart didn't match and I couldn't figure out what was happening. I reached out to a classmate to discuss. We looked at the code I entered to see if the data on the backend was the result. I had a few typos, specifically I left out an = on the bottom end, and I wrote the wrong number in my top end. Once I fixed all my formulas it looked just right! 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
  1. Successful campaign occurences are highest in May.
  2. However, this could just be a result of the most campaigns are launched in May. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  1. Setting low goals increases chances of success. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  1. We need more data to identify why there is a jump in successful campaigns among the 30-50 Thousand dollar range.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  1. Some other analyses that maybe useful is number of backers and their relation to successes and values pledged. To hone in on the potential role of  
  promotion, or virality within kickstarter campaign?
